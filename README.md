# Customer_Review_Scraping
I developed an application to collect customer reviews automatically from online vendors.

This tool's purpose is to get data easily and quickly for tasks such as text mining, analysis, classification, topic modeling, etc.

This application's code is highly adaptable to any website thanks to its functional modularity. It can be used for different online vendors with a small configuration on the data-parsing part.
